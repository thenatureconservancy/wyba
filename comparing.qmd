### Comparing Past vs. Present Conditions

Using LANDFIRE’s BpS products, we explore two different ways to visualize past vs. current vegetation patterns. 

* First we present **changes in broad ecosystem types** using an interactive comparison diagram. 

* Second we compare **amounts of succession classes** (past and present) for the most prevalent ecosystems. 

## Comparing Broad Vegetation Trends
### Summary

* Broadly speaking, this subregion has not experienced significant ecosystem changes. Out of over 28 million acres of past sagebrush ecosystem(s) in the subregion, over 25 million acres remain as sagebrush. (To explore what these shrublands have converted to, hover over “Past Shrubland” in the diagram below.) 
* However, over 2.8 million acres of shrubland have been converted in the subregion. Roughly 5% of the subregion was converted from riparian and shrubland ecosystems to agriculture.
* Note: number presented when hovering equals acres.

## Succession classes for most dominant BpSs
- There is an under-representation of early successional classes across all ecosystems types in this subregion
- Inter-Mountain Basins Mat Saltbrush Shrubland / Montane Sagebrush Steppe both have substantial amounts of uncharacteristic native vegetation, which may be associated with Pinyon Juniper encroachment
- Rocky Mountain Montane Riparian Systems have the highest level of agriculture
