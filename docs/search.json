These nationwide geospatial data products reflect current and historic conditions and include ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and land management decisions."

Out of over 28 million acres of past sagebrush ecosystem(s) in the subregion, over 25 million acres remain as sagebrush. (To explore what these shrublands have converted to, hover over “Past Shrubland” in the diagram below.)\nHowever, over 2.8 million acres of shrubland have been converted in the subregion. Roughly 5% of the subregion was converted from riparian and shrubland ecosystems to agriculture."
