## Goals of this demonstration

We will use [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/){target="blank"} products to:

1. Characterize and map past and present ecosystem conditions
2. Explore historical disturbance patterns
3. Summarize patterns of change and management opportunities


The following charts, maps, and graphs are based on current LANDFIRE products, and provide a starting point for further analysis.

This demonstration will:

* Provide context for the past and present ecosystem conditions the Wyoming Sagebrush Subregion, one of the [Southern Rockies Fire Science Network's](https://www.southernrockiesfirescience.org/){target="blank"} (SRFSN) six Subregions
* Demonstrate the power of data visualization to explore ecological patterns and functions using LANDFIRE products
* Facilitate an understanding of historical and current conditions on a regional scale

## Location

The SRFSN Wyoming Sagebrush Subregion is located in Central/South central Wyoming and far northwestern Colorado- [Read more](https://www.southernrockiesfirescience.org/wyoming-sagebrush/){target="blank"}.
