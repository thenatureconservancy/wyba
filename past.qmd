### LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings (BpSs)

BpS models represent the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement. These models are based on a combination of the current environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime. [Read more](https://landfire.gov/bps.php){target="blank"}.

Check out this 3-minute tutorial for a quick refresher on the [basics of Biophysical Settings Models](https://youtu.be/xjaWJCe7udQ){target="blank"}.

Use this page as a starting point to explore the most prevalent BpSs in the SRFSN Wyoming Sagebrush Subregion. In addition to the charts and maps, the historical disturbance data can be directly accessed using this site. 

## Summary

* Prior to European colonization, the most dominant vegetation system for the Wyoming Sagebrush Subregion was [Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland-Wyoming Big Sagebrush](https://landfirereview.org/search.php?q=Inter-Mountain%20Basins%20Big%20Sagebrush%20Shrubland-Wyoming%20Big%20Sagebrush&hPP=20&idx=lf_landfire_dev&p=0&is_v=1){target="blank"}.
* This system burned on average 4x more than the next most common ecosystem (Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe).
* The most prevalent LANDFIRE Mean Fire Return Interval (from BpS) was 76-100 years.
